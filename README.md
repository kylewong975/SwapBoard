# SwapperHeroes

Did you love superheroes in your youth?

Have you looked up to superheroes such as Spiderman or Batman?

Wouldn't it be amazing to see what your daughter as Wonder Woman or your son as The Incredible Hulk?


With SwapperHeroes, you can do just that! Trained with state-of-the-art Cycle-GAN (Zhu et al., 2017) architecture, SwapperHeroes can transform videos of anyone into those of superheroes to real time.

Our chatbot can provide additional information about your favorite superheroes! Character information may be retrieved through the Marvel API. Superhero-themed products may be easily searched through the eBay API.

In the future, we hope to incorporate user accounts, including a database to save favorite characters as well as alerts for favorite products (which could alert the user using the Twilio API).
